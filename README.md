# House Marketplace: Built with React and Firebase

House Marketplace is a web application built with React and Firebase, where users can list, browse, and find houses for sale or rent. The platform enables sellers to create property listings with detailed information and images, while buyers can look for listings according to their needs. The application uses Firebase for backend services, including authentication, database management, and hosting.

## Key Features:

- User authentication (sign up/login with Firebase Auth/login with Google OAuth).
- Add, edit, and delete property listings.
- Filter houses by category (sale/rent).
- Real-time database with Firebase Firestore.
- Responsive design for seamless use across devices.
